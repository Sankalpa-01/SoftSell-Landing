# SoftSell Landing Page

## Description

SoftSell is a sleek and responsive landing page designed to showcase the features and services of a platform for selling items. The landing page includes smooth scrolling navigation, interactive components, and a mobile-responsive menu.

## Features Implemented

- **Hero Section**:  
  Displays a large introductory headline with a Call-to-Action (CTA) button.
  
- **How It Works Section**:  
  Step-by-step interactive guide with icons and descriptions, built with animations using `framer-motion`.

- **Why Choose Us Section**:  
  A list of benefits presented with icons for each feature.
  
- **Testimonials Section**:  
  Dummy customer reviews with a simple card design.

- **Contact Form Section**:  
  A basic form to gather user contact information with frontend validation.

- **Responsive Navigation**:  
  A hamburger-style menu for mobile devices using `lucide-react` icons for the menu toggle. Smooth scrolling to sections when a menu item is clicked.

- **Dark Mode**:  
  Integrated support for dark mode, which automatically switches the color scheme based on system settings.

- **Animations**:  
  Smooth animations on page load and when hovering over elements using `framer-motion` for transitions.

## Design Choices

- **Color Scheme**:  
  Light and dark themes with complementary colors for readability and a modern look. Used Tailwind CSS for utility-first design and easy customization.

- **Icons**:  
  Icons from `lucide-react` to ensure a consistent and scalable set of high-quality icons throughout the design.

- **Animation Library**:  
  `framer-motion` was chosen for its ease of use in creating smooth animations and transitions. It enhances the user experience without overwhelming the interface.

- **Responsiveness**:  
  The layout is responsive, adjusting fluidly across all screen sizes using Tailwind CSS's built-in responsive utilities.

- **Accessibility**:  
  Ensured high contrast between text and background for accessibility. Added `aria-label` attributes to the menu toggle for improved accessibility.

  Setting up the React project with Tailwind CSS, establishing the folder structure, and designing the basic layout.
